# Overrun
A cyberpunk RPG based on Shadowrun.
The year is 2050. Megacorporations rule the world and technonauts access the Matrix through a datajack and a cyberdeck.

Overrun is a RPG based on the Shadowrun universe (FASA, 1989) with minimal graphics. The objective is to fulfill several missions of sabotage and data extraction from corporate systems. Overrun has a mission generator, as well as a story told through dialogue with NPCs.

This is an updated version of a game I made in 1996 using QBASIC. This version was made in Twine and uses media resources (graphics and sounds) to create turn-based combat mechanics on a 2D top-down map.

How to play:
Links and buttons are visually indicated by ">>>" or [brackets]. Click on your neuroterminal items (in the lower left corner) to see the description in the help panel (in the lower right corner). When in a system, use the arrow keys to move. Click on the map icons to see the description or access other options. Caontins an integrated Help section that covers all the aspects of the game.
